## A survey of robotic grasping in an object-centric perspective

1. Introduction
 
	1.1 Brief overview of hand-centric grasping (hand design, hand kinematics, contact model, hand IK, reachability. A large amount of work focus on this part, with the assumption that a better hand will lead to a better grasp.)

	1.2 Introduction of object-centric grasping (force closure, form closure, caging)
 
	1.3 Core problems of object-centric robotic grasping (multi-contact planning, Compliant interaction, Robust manipulation)

2. Planning of object-centric grasping 
 
	2.1 Known objects (force-closure, caging)
 
	2.2 Familiar objects (Learning)
 
	2.3 Unknown objects (Learning)

3. Control interaction of object-centric grasping (The goal is to keep the stabilty of the grasped object.)
 
	3.1 Dynamics of hand-object system
 
	3.2 Learning to stable grasps
 
	3.3 Robust closed-loop execution

4. Control of Constrained Object Manipulation (The goal is to change the configuration of the grasped object, with respect to the hand frame or base frame.)

	4.1 Pushing

5. Discussion and Conclusion

	5.1 Still open problems

	5.2 Next place to go
